Kitaev chain and Ising spin chain are ‘equivalent’ in some abstract algebraic sense leading to the Majorana zero modes being called ‘Ising anyons’ sometimes.  I do not know the references where this has been worked out in depth, but this seems to be the accepted wisdom.  See, e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5262 and Refs. 16-18 in this paper.

We wrote a paper showing that the nanowire quantum criticality is in the Ising universality class: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06033

It would be interesting to carry out a Jordan-Wigner transformation on the 1D SC-SM pristine nanowire Hamiltonian to see what type of spin model it transforms into, and whether this spin model can be identified as some type of Ising model.

This is somewhat high priority for me since I want to do something outside disorder physics.  Also, you need to do some purely non-numerical research.  This problem is completely analytical.

Let me know.


The boundary conditions matter (periodic versus antiperiodic) and the Ising chain may need Z2 flux attachments, but it is all straightforward algebra I believe.

 

Often the Ising spin and the topological fermion SC models are called ‘dual’ to each other with the same topological and critical properties.
